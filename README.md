# **Build a Text Adventure**

The Build a Text Adventure program [ . . . ]. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to declare variables using C++.

## Project Prompt

Create a C++ text adventure with the storyline of your choosing. The program should use your knowledge of C++ conditionals, logic, and loops.

Your program should have a storyline with:

- a beginning
- at least three possible endings
- It can help to map out your ideas on paper and draw out your possible branches before you begin coding anything.

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `cppprogram.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

### Command Line / Bash

```git
g++ cppprogram.cpp -o cppprogram
./cppprogram
```

### Command Prompt

```git
g++ cppprogram.cpp -o cppprogram
cppprogram.exe
```

## Sources

The techniques utilized was based on the lessons taught in [Codecademy's Learn C++ Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus
). The challenge is also provided by Codecademy.
